```bash
yarn cypress:verify
yarn cypress:open
## Run a test-suite in cypress ... this will destroy the coverage folder and add the new test results to the coverage folder.
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html 

yarn cypress:open
## Run a different test/test-suite in cypress and see the coverage folder update
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html 
```

You could also consider using: 
```bash
npx cypress run
```

note, this seems to have a bug that cypress run will update code coverage if new lines were hit.
but it will not decrease code coverage if some of those tests were deleted and it only has 1 test to run.
